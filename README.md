# FTB_GoCode_Server

A server for our entry for Go Code Colorado 2018

An Database, API, and server side script that is a work in progress.  Ideally the server will pull data from two different API end points and populate the results to our database.  Then the server will be available to our front end for creating an algorithm similar to Charity Navigator's, but with a business focus.
